# JEE4340_Matlab
### Matlab functions used during JEE4340 (Power Electronics) class.

In this repo I compiled the functions I used during Power Electronics class. This includes: AC rectifiers simulation, DC to AC inverters simulation and analysis, thyristor calculations. 
Project explores: Fast Fourier analysis of voltage waveforms, plotting of recreated signal, performance parameters for waveforms, iterative solution for extinction angle of a thyristor.  

### Files description:
inverters_project: Analysis of DC to AC inverters performance through FFT.
rectifiers_fft: Analysis of AC to DC rectifiers performance through FFT.
analyze_signal.m: Function that analyzes waveform through Fast Fourier, calculates current and parameters if load is given.
construct_signal.m: older version of analyze_signal used for rectifiers project.
bonus_project.m: Thyristor extinction angle calculation.
