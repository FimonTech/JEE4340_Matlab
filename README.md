## JEE4340_Matlab
# Matlab functions used during JEE4340 (Power Electronics) class.

In this repo I compiled the functions I used during Power Electronics class. This includes: AC rectifiers simulation, DC to AC inverters simulation and analysis, thyristor calculations. 
Project explores: Fast Fourier analysis of voltage waveforms, plotting of recreated signal, performance parameters for waveforms, iterative solution for extinction angle of a thyristor.
